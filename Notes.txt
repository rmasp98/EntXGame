This is a notepad for things I need to do or think about

TODO:
 1. I need to set up deferred rendering for my lighting
 2. Add material shiniess to entity
 3. Clean up what we pass to shaders (could pass it in blocks)
 4. Shadows! (https://learnopengl.com/#!Advanced-Lighting/Shadows/Shadow-Mapping and https://learnopengl.com/#!Advanced-Lighting/Shadows/Point-Shadows)
   f. create the shadow shaders
   g. Need to create VAOs for shadow buffer
   h. pass the cube map to main shaders
   i. Alter main shaders to account for shadows
 5. Normal mapping (https://learnopengl.com/#!Advanced-Lighting/Normal-Mapping)
 6. Keymap menu
 7. Fix issue with recentering boxes that are not pushed all the way off Goal
 8. Make easier to push boxes into corridors
 9. Write solution finder
 11. Need to improve object and image loader (and therefore the renderer as well)
 12. Need to set up random level generator with petential threading (really big job)
 13. Fix player vibrating in corners
 18. Tidy up entity storage and buffer generation (may not need to store all I do currently)



Things to think about:
 - Need to set up multisampling capability in textures (https://learnopengl.com/#!Advanced-OpenGL/Anti-Aliasing)
 - Think about setting up instancing for boxes (https://learnopengl.com/#!Advanced-OpenGL/Instancing)
 - Paralax mapping. Its cool but not really needed at this point (https://learnopengl.com/#!Advanced-Lighting/Parallax-Mapping)
 - High Dynamic Range (HDR) compensates for extremes in light exposure (https://learnopengl.com/#!Advanced-Lighting/HDR)
 - Bloom, blurs bright light sources (https://learnopengl.com/#!Advanced-Lighting/Bloom)
 - Potentially add SSAO (https://learnopengl.com/#!Advanced-Lighting/SSAO)


Done:
 4. shadows
   a. geometry shader loader
   b. remove all reference to shaders directly in entities
   c. load shaders in render system
   d. rearrange renderer to minimise the ammount passed to shader per entity
   e. add preparation stuff for shadow pass
 10. Need to sort out input system for menu code
 14. Resume button in in-game menu raises camera a little - because not updating cursor position in input entity (see 10)
 15. Implement Blinn-phong lighting (https://learnopengl.com/#!Advanced-Lighting/Advanced-Lighting)
 16. Add gamma correction to final shader pass (https://learnopengl.com/#!Advanced-Lighting/Gamma-Correction)
 17. Resume button in in-game menu returns to main menu - was finding cursor position multiple times
