This is a notepad for things I need to do or think about

TODO:
 - I need to set up deferred rendering for my lighting
 - Implement Blinn-phong lighting (https://learnopengl.com/#!Advanced-Lighting/Advanced-Lighting)
 - Add gamma correction to final shader pass (https://learnopengl.com/#!Advanced-Lighting/Gamma-Correction)
 - Shadows! (https://learnopengl.com/#!Advanced-Lighting/Shadows/Shadow-Mapping and https://learnopengl.com/#!Advanced-Lighting/Shadows/Point-Shadows)
 - Normal mapping (https://learnopengl.com/#!Advanced-Lighting/Normal-Mapping)
 - Keymap menu
 - Fix issue with recentering boxes that are not pushed all the way off Goal
 - Make easier to push boxes into corridors
 - Write solution finder
 - Need to sort out input system for menu code
 - Need to improve object and image loader (and therefore the renderer as well)
 - Need to set up random level generator with petential threading (really big job)


Things to think about:
 - Need to set up multisampling capability in textures (https://learnopengl.com/#!Advanced-OpenGL/Anti-Aliasing)
 - Think about setting up instancing for boxes (https://learnopengl.com/#!Advanced-OpenGL/Instancing)
 - Paralax mapping. Its cool but not really needed at this point (https://learnopengl.com/#!Advanced-Lighting/Parallax-Mapping)
 - High Dynamic Range (HDR) compensates for extremes in light exposure (https://learnopengl.com/#!Advanced-Lighting/HDR)
 - Bloom, blurs bright light sources (https://learnopengl.com/#!Advanced-Lighting/Bloom)
 - Potentially add SSAO (https://learnopengl.com/#!Advanced-Lighting/SSAO)
